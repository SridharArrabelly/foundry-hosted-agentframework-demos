"""
Workflow Stage 1: Writer → Reviewer workflow using a Foundry-hosted model.

Two AI agents in a chain:
    writer → formatter

The writer drafts a short article, and the formatter styles it with Markdown and emojis.
Agents are passed directly as executors to WorkflowBuilder (no need
for explicit AgentExecutor wrapping).

Prerequisites:
    - An Azure OpenAI / Foundry model deployment
    - `az login` (uses DefaultAzureCredential)
    - .env with:
        AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource>.openai.azure.com
        AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-5.2

Run:
    python workflows/stage2_agent_executors.py
